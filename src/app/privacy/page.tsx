            1 Collection and processing of data
          </h2>
          <p>
            For services provided from the USA and elsewhere, each of the
            services are run by a Label group company (as applicable), which
            collects personal data in connection with that service and acts as
            the data controller for such data, and such Label&rsquo;s principal
            place of business is 1221 16th Ave. South, Nashville, TN, 37212.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just to be clear, this policy does not, however, apply to any Label
            group sites for which a different privacy policy is posted or linked
            from time to time.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the services to which this policy does apply, we, as well as our
            affiliated Label companies, artists and/or writers and/or our or
            their third-party suppliers, technology partners and/or marketing
            partners (all of the foregoing together, our
            &ldquo;partners&rdquo;), may collect and process certain personal
            data relating to you, i.e. information that identifies (or makes it
            possible to identify) you as a natural person (e.g. your name,
            postal address, email address, telephone number, date of birth, age,
            country of residence and/or IP address). We and/or our partners may
            collect such information when you take part in various opportunities
            and services provided via the site or a partner site, such as when
            you participate in an artist- or label-related marketing campaign
            via the site or a partner site or otherwise engage with our content,
            or when you purchase products, services or digital content through a
            store that is associated with the site (if any, the
            &ldquo;store&rdquo;, which may be hosted by a third-party supplier).
          </p>
          <p>
            Processing means any operation that is performed on personal data,
            such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage,
            adaptation, retrieval, any kind of disclosure, erasure or
            destruction or other use. For example, we process personal data when
            you:

            3 Newsletter

            This section 3 only applies if we offer a newsletter via the site or
            the store (from us or from any of our partners).
          </p>
          <p>
            When you subscribe to the newsletter, we will only send it to you by
            email if you confirm your email address (e.g. by clicking on a link
            via the site or in a notification email). In that case, we will
            store and use your relevant personal data (including your email
            address), the time of registration, the IP address used for
            registration and the location from which you registered. Your
            subscription to any newsletter relating to any particular Label
            artist shall be deemed your consent to receive similar newsletters
            from any other Label artist and/or any artist signed to current or
            future affiliates thereof.
          </p>
          <p>
            The purposes of such processing are (a) to send you editions of the
            newsletter, (b) to confirm your registration and (c) to gather data
            to help us analyse how to improve the newsletter and/or to inform
            our analysis for customised online advertising (where permitted).
            The legal basis of the processing is your consent (as far as given)
            or otherwise our legitimate interest in undertaking such
            confirmation and analysis.
          </p>
          <p>
            If, when subscribing to the newsletter, you also consent to receive
            information about our and/or selected third parties&rsquo; products,
            services or content, the provision of that information is based on
            that consent.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time by clicking on
            the link provided in each of our newsletters or sending us an email
            at info@big-machine-records.com. If unsubscribing, please state the
            name (such as the relevant label or artist name) of the mailing list
            that you wish to be removed from. You can also, at any time,
            withdraw your consent to receive such direct marketing
            communications by sending us an email to that effect at
            info@big-machine-records.com. In either case, such request will only
            be effective going forward.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may still continue to process certain related data where
            permitted (e.g. to give effect to your preference), unless you have
            any relevant rights to restrict or prevent such processing and
            exercise those rights (as further explained hereinbelow).
          </p>
          <p>
            For our newsletters we may also use commercially established
            technologies that enable us to measure interactions with the
            newsletter (e.g. emails opened and links clicked). If applicable, we
            use such data for general statistical evaluations, as well as for
            the optimisation and further development of our content and customer
            communication and/or to inform our analysis for customized online
            advertising (where permitted). That information is collected using
            small graphics embedded in the newsletter (known as
            &ldquo;pixels&rdquo;), which can also collect technical data about
            the device you use. The legal basis for this is your consent (as far
            as given) or otherwise our legitimate interest in understanding how
            users interact with the newsletter and in improving our content and
            customer communication and/or the relevance of customised online
            advertising (where permitted).
          </p>
          <p>
            Through our newsletter we want to share content that is as relevant
            as possible for our customers and to gain a better understanding of
            what readers are actually interested in. If you do not wish to be
            involved in the analysis of such usage behaviour, you can
            unsubscribe from our newsletter or deactivate graphics in your email
            program by default.

              California residents&rsquo; requests, reporting on the number of
              access, deletion, and &ldquo;do not sell&rdquo; requests made, the
              number fulfilled (in whole or part) and the number denied. If that
              applies to us in due course, we shall provide a CCPA metrics
              reporting page on or via the site.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Do not track:</strong> Currently, we do not take any
              action to respond to &ldquo;do not track&rdquo; signals or similar
              signals, since a uniform technological standard has not yet been
              developed. We keep new technologies under review, and we might
              adopt a standard in due course.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Under-16s:</strong> CCPA has specific rules on the use of
              California information from consumers under 16 years old.
              Accordingly, if we knowingly collect California information of an
              under-16 consumer, we will not sell the information without
              affirmative permission to do so. If the consumer is between 13 and
              16 years old, the consumer may provide such permission. If the
              consumer is under 13, the consumer&rsquo;s parent or guardian must
              provide the permission. If you would like further information on
              how we handle California information from under-16 consumers,
              please contact us using the details set out in section 14 below.

            Those services include each of our label-related or artist-related
            websites, apps, data integration tools and software, as well as any

            About cookies
          </h2>
          <p>
            Cookies are widely used to allow online and mobile sites to function
            efficiently. A &ldquo;cookie&rdquo; is a small text file that
            (depending on your browser settings) is deposited on the hard drive
            of your computer, mobile phone, tablet or other smart device when
            you visit a site. The cookie may be sent back to that site when you
            visit again and may then be used by the server to identify and track
            your use of the site.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are two main types of cookie. A &ldquo;session cookie&rdquo;
            is a temporary cookie that only remains in the cookie file of your
            device until you leave a website. A &ldquo;persistent&rdquo; cookie
            is a long-term cookie that will be stored by your device until its
            set expiry date (unless you delete it before the expiry date).
          </p>
          <p>
            We may also use some other technologies that work in a broadly
            similar way, such as web beacons, software development kits or
            locally stored objects.
          </p>
          <p>
            We refer below to cookies and all such other similar technologies as
            &ldquo;cookies&rdquo;, for short.

            Rejecting and deleting cookies
          </h2>
          <p>
            If you object to the use of cookies on the site, most browsers can
            be configured to alert you to their use or to enable you to reject
            browser-based cookies. Third parties may use certain special types
            of cookies (such as flash cookies) that cannot be disabled by
            configuring browsers, although other methods of preventing or
            managing such cookies may be available to you (such as via the
            relevant third-party settings panel). You can also delete cookies
            already stored on your device.
          </p>
          <p>
            The site itself may also provide you with a cookie consent tool, in
            which case you can also set your cookies choices and preferences for
            the site using that tool (in addition to any other methods of cookie
            control described below).
          </p>
          <p>
            Further information on rejection and deletion of cookies, please
            visit your help or support page for your preferred internet browser.
          </p>
          <p>
            If, however, you decide to disable or delete any cookies, some parts
            or features of the site (especially interactive features) may not
            work properly. Disabling or deleting cookies may also affect your
            ability to use other online or mobile sites.

            Our own cookies
          </h2>
          <p>
            We use the following types of cookies via the site for the following
            purposes:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 flex flex-col gap-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Necessary:</strong> enabling core site functionality.
              Strictly necessary cookies are essential to allow you to move
              around the site and to use certain site features, such as access
              to secure areas or provision of appropriate content based on your
              type of device. We don&rsquo;t often use necessary cookies, but we
              may use them where required in that way.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Analytics:</strong> allowing us to analyse site usage.
              Analytics cookies collect information on how you use the site, so
              that we can analyse traffic and understand users&rsquo;
              interactions to perform analytics, including to analyse, measure
              and report on usage and performance of the site and marketing
              content. For this purpose, we may use third-party service
              providers such as Google, as explained further below.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Functional:</strong> enabling us to personalise your
              experience of the site. Functional cookies allow the site to
              remember choices that you make (such as your user name or
              location) and to provide more personalised features. We may also
              use them to provide services that you request or to remember
              changes that you have made to site features that you can
              customise. The main functional cookies used on the site are
              certain non-persistent cookies to identify you as you use the site
              and/or leave it to visit any store associated with the site (the
              &ldquo;store&rdquo;). That helps Label and our third-party
              partners to provide you with a good experience when you browse the
              site and the store and also allows Label and our third-party
              partners to improve the site and the store. In particular, where
              relevant, we may use functional cookies for log-in identification,
              for load distribution, to store your language settings, and to
              note that information placed on the site or store has been
              displayed to you so that on your next visit to the site or store
              it does not need to be displayed again.

            <li>
              <strong>Advertising:</strong> enabling advertising partners to
              serve customised online advertising. Advertising cookies allow us,
              our affiliates and our and their advertising partners to target
              advertising of products, services or content. Those cookies also
              facilitate, manage and measure the performance of adverts
              displayed on or delivered by or through the site. Those
              advertising partners may also have the capability to track your
              browsing across sites, apps and social media sites.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Social media:</strong> used when you share content with,
              or link to or from, social media. Social media cookies are used
              when you share content using a sharing button or &ldquo;like&rdquo;
              button on the site, or when you link your account or engage with
              our content on or through a social media site such as Facebook,
              Twitter, Google, Snapchat or TikTok. The social media site will

            The cookies do not contain any information that, in itself,
            personally identifies you and do not provide us with access to the
            rest of your device. We and such partners may, however, associate
            the information contained in cookies with personal information that
            you have provided to us or them separately.
          </p>
          <p>
            We or such partners might introduce further types of cookie from
            time to time to improve your experience of the site or the store. If
            we do so, we or they will provide details of any such usage on the
            site and/or (as relevant) the store.

          <p>
            Google Analytics is a web-analysis service that uses cookies to
            analyse and improve the site on the basis of the site user&rsquo;s
            usage pattern. The data accrued in this context may be transmitted
            by Google for analysis to a server in the USA and stored there.
            Should personal data be transmitted to the USA, Google has
            implemented appropriate safeguards. Your IP address will be
            abbreviated before the analysis of usage statistics, however, so
            that no conclusions can be drawn about your identity. For this
            purpose, Google Analytics has been extended on the site to include
            the code &ldquo;anonymizeIP&rdquo;, in order to guarantee an
            anonymised capture of IP addresses.
          </p>
          <p>
            Google will process the information so gained in order to evaluate
            your use of the site, to assemble reports on the site activities for
            the site operators, and to supply further services connected with
            website use and internet use.
          </p>
          <p>
            As set out above, you can configure your browser so that it rejects
            cookies, or you can prevent the capture of the data generated by
            cookies and relating to your use of the site (including your IP
            address) and the processing of such data by Google by downloading
            and installing the opt-out browser add-on provided by Google. As an
            alternative to the browser add-on or if you browse the site from a
            mobile device, you can use this opt-out link. This will prevent the
            data collection of Google Analytics within the site (the opt-out

          <p>
            Google Tag Manager is used to manage tracking tools and other
            services, so-called &ldquo;website tags&rdquo;. A tag is an element
            that is stored in the source code of the site in order to record,

            any personal data. The Google Tag Manager triggers other tags that
            may collect data. Some of the data are stored on a Google server in
            the USA. In the event that personal data are transferred to the USA,
            Google has implemented appropriate safeguards. If deactivation has
            been made at the domain or cookie level, it will remain in effect

            The Meta pixel is a piece of code that functions by setting and

            site, both on and off its platforms, such as Facebook and Instagram.
            The pixel gathers site usage data to help to optimise advertising
            across those platforms, including by measuring effectiveness of ads
            (e.g. tracking conversions from ads), building targeted audiences
            for future ads and remarketing to site users who have already taken
            some kind of action on the site.

          <p>
            On certain pages of the site or the store we may implement so-called
            &ldquo;social media&rdquo; plug-ins, such as Facebook&rsquo;s
            &ldquo;like&rdquo; button, Twitter&rsquo;s Twitter buttons and
            Google&rsquo;s &ldquo;+1&rdquo; button. When you visit a page that
            displays one or more of such buttons, your browser will establish a
            direct connection to the relevant social media server and load the
            button from there. At the same time the provider of the social media
            service will know that the relevant page on the site or the store
            has been visited.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have no influence on the data that any such social media provider
            collects on the basis of the buttons. According to the available
            information, however, if you do not click on the respective buttons,
            none of your personal data will be collected and stored unless you
            have logged onto to your social media account. In that case, certain
            user data (including your IP address at the time) may be collected
            and linked to the account information already present at the social
            media service. If you wish to prevent this, please log out of your
            social media accounts before visiting the site or the store.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, clicking a button may also lead to a collection of
            certain data, such as your IP address. Social media providers such
            as Meta, Twitter, Google, Snapchat and TikTok may set cookies as
            well, unless you have disabled the acceptance and storage of cookies
            in your browser settings (see above).

          <p>
            We receive no information from social media providers about which
            social media buttons you may personally have clicked or seen on the
